# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose
To create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. The employee will choose how many characters the password will have (between 8-128 characters), and they will choose if they want to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters as criteria in the password.  This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
